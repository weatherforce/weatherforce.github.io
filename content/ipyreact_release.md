## IpyWhat? 

We are proud to present __ipyreact__, our widget library for jupyter notebook. It uses React for the front end, which provides a simple way to build complex widgets. The aim is not to replace the great [ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets) project, but instead to offer an alternative.
 
## Why React? What for?  

React's state mechanism and JSX implementation gives developers great efficiency and usability benefits for building complex UIs. Ipyreact using React allows developers to use libraries from the React world in Jupyter notebooks. In the future, we would like to implement Material UI in ipyreact. This would provide high quality components, styling, animating and theming mechanisms that would dramatically enhance the quality of dashboards made from notebooks.

## Where do I start ? 

The project is quite young, yet it might become your next favorite widget library to build dashboards from notebooks!
