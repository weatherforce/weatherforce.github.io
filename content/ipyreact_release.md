## IpyWhat? 

We are proud to present __ipyreact__, a beta version of a widget library for jupyter notebook using React on the front end. The aim is not to replace the great [ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets) project. Instead, ipyreact focuses on providing an alternative solution building widgets. 

## Why React? What for?  

React allows us to leverage both its efficiency and usability, through the state mechanism, and of course, JSX. Furthermore, using React allows developers to easily incorporate the [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) library into their project taking advantage of cool features such as theming and its components library designed with UX/UI best practices. That use of good looking component with theming options might not be useful for notebooks use as internal tools to share code and experiment with it. However, It becomes necessary when it comes to build dashboard with tools such as Voila. In that particular case, the use of React as front end library will be very useful since it is its very purpose to provide a simple development tool for building complexe user interfaces. 


## Where do I start ? 

The project is quite young, yet it might become your next favorite widget library to build dashboards from notebooks!
