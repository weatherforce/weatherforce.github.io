# Do you like React? do you like ipywidgets? then you should have a look at IpyReactWidgets!

## IpyWhat? 

We are proud to present a simple yet functionning version of a widget library for jupyter notebook using React on the front end. It does not aim to replace the famous ipywidgets, but rather emphasis on providing an alternative solution focused on dashboards building. We felt like for this specific use case, a React implementation of ipywidgets would allow us to leverage both the efficiency and the easyness of use of React framework.

In addition, it open access to Material-UI, and all its cool features such as theming and its component library designed with UX/UI best practices. 

It is really just that: an ipywidgets implementation replacing backbone with React. It is right now quite simple, yet It might become your next favorite widget library to build dashboards from notebooks in the future!
