# Do you like React? Do you like ipywidgets? Then you should have a look at ipyreactwidgets!

## IpyWhat? 

We are proud to present a simple yet functioning version of a widget library for jupyter notebook using React for the front end. The aim is not to replace the great [ipywidgets](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets) project. Instead, the project focuses on providing an alternative solution focused on using React for building widgets. A React implementation of ipywidgets allows us to leverage both the efficiency and usability of the React framework. Furthermore, using React allows developers to easily incorporate the [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) library into their project taking advantage of cool features such as theming and its components library designed with UX/UI best practices.

It is really just that: an ipywidgets implementation replacing backbone.js with React. The aim is that you should be able to easily use and create your React components in jupyter-notebooks. The project is now quite young, yet it might become your next favorite widget library to build dashboards from notebooks!
